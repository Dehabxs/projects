 <p id="summary"> <b>Daft Punk</b> was a highly influential and iconic French electronic music duo consisting of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They were active from 1993 to 2021. The duo gained worldwide fame for their unique blend of electronic, house, and disco music, along with their signature robot personas and futuristic visuals.

    Daft Punk's breakthrough came in the late 1990s with their debut album "Homework," which featured hits like "Around the World" and "Da Funk."
